# python_big_or_small_game

This game is called BIG or SMALL, you should guess what is the next card would be? bigger or 
smaller than the last one????

1- Basically you start with an amount of $100, and you can bet whatever you want.
2- The computer will shuffle the deck, and open the first card.
For example - 2 of Diamond
Then it is your time to guess if is bigger or smaller than 2 of diamond.

If you get the right answer you double you stack, if you get the wrong answer you lose everything
You have the option to stop if you think that is to guess (for example: 7 of Spades).

In order to kill the curiosity if you could have a better streak, you have the option to check 
what was the sequence of the deck.
